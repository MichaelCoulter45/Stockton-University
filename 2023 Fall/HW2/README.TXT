Only need to change the Average method in Data.java
and the filter method in BankAccount.java





/*
 * End of chapter programming projects P10.5 on page 509 (5 Edition) or page 514 (6 edition) of the textbook. 
 Please use the code from section 10.1 as as starting point instead of from 10.4 (as the instruction in the question is not correct)
This is an example on how to implement two interface for one class
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4546807/implementing-multiple-interfaces-with-java-is-there-a-way-to-delegate
A few hint. you need to create multiple accounts (array maybe?) and run them through the filter method to determine if they qualify or not. ($1000)
Due 10/9 (both the project code zipped + screenshot of how the code ran)
